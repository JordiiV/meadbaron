### Technology

Since i was a child i liked tech and all this stuff. My first contact with it was a Gameboy color (90's kid inside) and i fall in love with it and with everything that has been coming. 
Even so, until 2017 I had not studied anything related in a serious way, just like a hobby or for fun.BUT, in 2017, i decided to take a different direction in my career and recover past interests. Was in that moment when i started to learn about developing, specifically Front-end technologies, and i liked, a lot.
Actually i work in a tech consultancy here in BCN with front-end techs like HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and React+redux as framework, but I still learning everyday.

### Caster / Narrator

Almost at the same time i decided to learn about developing, also decided to enroll a team that works in the e-sports world, and become a League of legends caster (analyst). 
Yeah, 2017 was a year full of changes for me, but i dont regret about a thing, because I dared to do many things that I had not done before and that I really wanted to do or try. This experience has given me and keeps giving me a lot of experience in comunicating skills and helps me to lose the fear of talk in public and be more proactive (also helped in my speech, especially when i gave conferences).

### Botany

This one is of my grandfather's legacy, both of them love the earth, nature and get their hands dirty, maybe because of that i prefered archaeology before pure history, who knows.
The fact is that I always see they working in their gardens and enjoying it, and i get that knowledge and started to learn about botany, how to germinate, make cuttings and grow a lot of plants. Actually i'm the proud owner of an urban garden in my home, and cultivate my own vegetables, herbs and flowers.

### Archaeology

Before i started to learn about developing, i cursed and finished a career, Archaeology. Oh, Archaeology, one of my greatests passions since i was a little piece of sh***t and i was staring at the tv documentarys about ancient egypt, mesopotamian people and other societys that precede us. 
In first term, i decided to do this career to be an underwater archaeologyst, placing together two of my passions, diving (THE SEA IS WONDERFUL) and history/archaeology, and with my parents help, i have been able to do it. 
I get the necessary diving courses in the first year of career and i enrolled all the archaeological interventions (underwater or not) that i can, with the time i had (mostly sacrificing the summer, but it was soooooo worth it).
During this years, I have met many wonderful people and made a lot of friends, but at the moment to search a job, the things went worst because the situation of archaeology in Spain is mostly awful and precarius (with exceptions of course).
I have also given conferences about archeology, specifically about my bachelor's thesis.Then, i decided to make the reroll.

### Diving

It will look like when I was a kiddo I already knew what was going to like me as a man, but my likes remain almost the same, and diving (scuba diving and apnea, even spearfishing) was not going to be an exception.
I started to dive in the sea and pools before i learned to swim (obvious no? if you don't know how to swim, you sink) but like other childs, i liked the sensation of being underwater, the calm silence surounds me and give me peace, and this feel is one of the best i ever felt.
